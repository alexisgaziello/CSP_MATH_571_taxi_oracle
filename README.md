## Motivation
Developing a model that could benefit a private transportation company by saving a lot of time searching for passengers.
In order to make the private company’s taxis reach more customers and earn a good reputation among them, the goal is to minimize the waiting time of customers.
Other external factors that have to be considered to design the best model include weather and holidays. 
- Extreme weather conditions affecting the customers’ rapid service.
- Public holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas etc. and weekends where the demand of taxis would be higher than usual.

## Problem Statement
- To create a model that will predict the demand of taxis per hour and location that a private transportation company will need to perform trips, at a given location and time. 
- The performance of this model will be analyzed not just in terms of prediction error (MAE and MSE), but also in terms of financial profit.

## Importance of Problem :
- Our model will be helpful in predicting the number of taxi trips per each pickup community area every hour in Chicago.
- By utilizing our model, the company will be able to know much in advance the communities of Chicago where there is demand for a greater number of taxis so that only taxi drivers in that area can respond
- The private company will be able to make more profit by saving the time taken by taxi drivers particularly by avoiding the long-distance pickups. 
- Deploying the exact number of taxi drivers in the pickup community will avoid wasting resources of the company and result in overall good customer satisfaction.
