## How can we make public transportation better?
Our ojective is to improve the public transportation system of Chicago. For that we are thinking of using the following datasets:
- CTA public transportation data
- Taxi transportation data
- Weather data

The objective is to contrast these three datasets and see if there are some defficient areas in which taxis are preferred over public transportation.
